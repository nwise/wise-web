This morning I hooked one side of it to my TV and the other to my home network.  Instantly it found all my shared files (mostly my MP3 library).

I can take this thing apart, refactor the software, and make it do things that the manufacturer did not imagine.  I mean, think about it.  How much does a DVR cost, and the monthly cost?  Do you get to keep your recorded programs?  Can you add storage? Do you get free upgrades?  Can you export your recorded shows to your portable media player, or your computer, or your website?

Sure, I can follow the 44-step instructions and have an exact replica of the castle shown on the outside of the box.

I could build an action figure out of Legos, sure it's not going to look just like my Snake Eyes G.I. Joe, but that's not the point.  With an G.I. Joe, I don't get a choice.  Sure it's still play, and it got the job done, but G.I. Joe was never as fun as Legos.  I think the constructive toys I had growing up have put me in a mindset that harmonizes with Open Source, maybe not.

This morning I hooked one side of it to my TV and the other to my home network.  Instantly it found all my shared files (mostly my MP3 library).  After poking around the wiki site I found that I could access it through the network from another computer.  \"Sounds like fun\", I thought.

I can take this thing apart, refactor the software, and make it do things that the manufacturer did not imagine.  I mean, think about it.  How much does a DVR cost, and the monthly cost?  Do you get to keep your recorded programs?  Can you add storage? Do you get free upgrades?  Can you export your recorded shows to your portable media player, or your computer, or your website?  This device does all that, and, because it's open source, I can make it do it any way I want.  Or I can find someone else who has added features and take their work and use it on my device.</p>\n\n<p>Open source is about freedom and creativity.  I recently dug out my Legos.  They have got to be my favorite toy.  They are a great example of an open system.  Sure, I can follow the 44-step instructions and have an exact replica of the castle shown on the outside of the box.  But I can also take as little or as much of those instructions I want and use the pieces to craft anything else.  The nature of Legos is to provide a system by which any number of objects can be constructed.  Freedom and creativity.  </p>\n\n<p>Besides the fact that I did not have many action figures growing up, the ones I did have weren't my toy of choice.  I could build an action figure out of Legos, sure it's not going to look just like my Snake Eyes G.I. Joe, but that's not the point.  With an G.I. Joe, I don't get a choice.  Sure it's still play, and it got the job done, but G.I. Joe was never as fun as Legos.  I think the constructive toys I had growing up have put me in a mindset that harmonizes with Open Source, maybe not.  All I know is that I'd rather have a bunch of versatile, standard-based pieces that allow me to build the DVR I want then a slick-looking device that limits my fun based on market-driven price-per-feature scheme.  </p>\n\n<p>Freedom yields creativity and that is the foundation of true fun.

There seems to be so much pressure to make Christmas a memorable event, that we miss the point.  A good friend of me refers to this phenomenon as \"hurry up and have fun\".  \r\n\r\nI'm not interested in making every minute count.  Remember what you know.  What I know is that when I become a slave to my schedule and pressure myself to 'make the most' of my time, I miss out on a lot of opportunities to just enjoy people in my life.  Relationships are not something that fits a timeline or fills a time slot on a schedule.\r\n\r\nI think the best thing you can do this Christmas is let go of your schedule.  Relax and enjoy your situation.  Enjoy your family.  Just because you can accomplish a lot, doesn't mean you should.  Consider whether your achievements will be as rewarding as your relationships.  \r\n\r\n\"These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives\"; Remember what you know.", "keywords"=>""}, "current_editor"=>"simple", "authenticity_token"=>"adc0efe12ca45954765c4943aa5a8649ccedeef6", "id"=>"5", "attachments"=>{"filename_1"=>""}}
